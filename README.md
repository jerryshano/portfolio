# 🌐 Personal Portfolio

A modern, responsive developer portfolio built with **React.js**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
While this portfolio started from a tutorial, I deliberately wrote all the code myself and studied every step.
This project reflects not only my growing skills with React and Tailwind CSS, but also my ability to adapt and 
extend an existing design into my own professional portfolio.
